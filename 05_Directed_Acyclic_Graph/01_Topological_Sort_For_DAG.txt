Topological sorting for Directed Acyclic Graph(DAG) is a linear ordering
of vertices such that fpr every directed edge u v, vertex u comes before v 
in the ordering. Topological sorting for a graph is not possible if the
graph is not a DAG.

Application ->

1. Scheduling jobs from the given dependencies among jobs.
2. Instruction Scheduling.
3. Ordering of formula cell evaluation when recomputing formula values in spreadsheets.
4. Logic Synthesis.
5. Determining the order of compilation tasks to perform in make files, 
data serialization, and resolving symbol dependencies in linkers.
