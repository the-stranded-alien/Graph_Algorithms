Shortest Path Algorithms

Single Source Shortest Path

1. BFS 
-> Only for Unweighted Graph
-> Single Source Shortest Path (SSSP)
-> O(V + E) Time

2. Dijkstra's Algorithm
-> Weighted Graph
-> Single Source Shortest Path (SSSP)
-> Greedy Algorithm
-> Dijkstra Doesn't Work for Graphs with Negative Weight Edges.

3. Bellman Ford Algorithm
-> Weighted Graph
-> Single Source Shortest Path (SSSP)
-> Bellman Ford Works for Graphs with Negative Weight Edges.

All-Pairs Shortest Path

4. Floyd Warshall Algorithm
-> All Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP)
-> Dynamic Programming based Algorithm
