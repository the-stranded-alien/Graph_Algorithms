Graph Key Concepts

-> Vertex & Edge

Types of Graph =>

1. Weighted Graph -> Graphs whose edges or paths have values called weights.
Edge value represent weight/cost/length.

2. Unweighted Graph -> There is no value or weight associated with the edge. By
default, all the graphs are unweighted unless there is a value associated.

3. Undirected Graph -> All edges are bi-directional.

4. Directed Graph -> Edges are directed from one node to another.
